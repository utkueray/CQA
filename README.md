# CQA

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Download the project by cloning the following link or download the zip version from Github.

```
https://github.com/utkueray/CQA.git
```

Please use Python3, if possible Python 3.6.X or Python 3.8.X version, assuming that it will work on Python 3.7.X but never tested it.

Also, please use version 3 of Pip while installing.

You may have to define Python and Pip version while running scripts, therefore becareful while copying commands.



### Installing

After downloading the project file, you have to open a command line with Python 3.6.X or Python 3.8.X installed and navigate to the project folder.

You can install necessary python libraries with typing the following command in to your command line.


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Also, you have to run the following script in command line to generate doc2vec model in the predefined path.

```
python generateModel.py
```

or

```
python3 generateModel.py
```
## Additional Note (If you want to update the data dump.)

If you want to update the doc2vec model and the dataframes used in the system with latest datadump, you can download the data dump from [https://archive.org/download/stackexchange/ai.stackexchange.com.7z](https://archive.org/download/stackexchange/ai.stackexchange.com.7z) and repace Posts.xml and Users.xml files in the root directory with the new ones. Now, you have to run both Task1 and Task2 ipynb files and they will generate necessary dataframes in predefined paths. Finally, you have to run following command again in the command line to generate the updated mode.


```
python generateModel.py
```

or

```
python3 generateModel.py
```

## Running

Running the system is fairly easy after installing necessary python libraries.
Enter the following command to your command line, or you can use a PyCharm which is tested and works fine.

```
python manage.py runserver 80
```

or

```
python3 manage.py runserver 80
```

or ( if you are using MAC OS)

```
sudo python3 manage.py runserver 80
```
